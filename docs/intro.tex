\section{INTRODUCTION}
    Python is a dynamically typed general purpose programming language 
    that has gained popularity due to its simplicity and conciseness.
    However, without the benefits of static typing, it becomes easy for
    a programmer to shoot themself in the foot. The release of Python3.5
    introduced type hints into the AST, which galvanized the development 
    of several third party typecheckers for Python (MyPy, Pyre).
